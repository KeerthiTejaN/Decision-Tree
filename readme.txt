While executing the file, it asks the user which measure of impurity they want to use in order to classify. The user has to enter either gini or entropy (any other value other than gini is taken as entropy by default.)The system then prompts for file path of the dataset user wants to make classification on. Please enter the file path in the similarities way:	/Users/KeerthiTejaNuthi/Downloads/iris.data.txtAny filepath that starts with a back slash is accepted.

The program is developed initially while taking Iris dataset as its input. So, all the datasets must be formatted similar to iris dataset before giving them for classification i.e., last column must contain the class label. All the values of all attributes must be numerical. The data file must not contain column headers or column names.
